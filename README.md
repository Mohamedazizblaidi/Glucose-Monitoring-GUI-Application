# 🩺 Glucose Monitoring GUI – Simple Python Project

This is a **simple desktop application** built with **Python**, designed to help users **track and visualize glucose levels** over time.  
The app uses a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** made with `customtkinter` and stores data locally using `sqlite3`.  
It applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and integrates several powerful Python libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Add and manage glucose readings
- Analyse data using **Pandas**
- Display glucose data in a **matplotlib** line chart  
- Store data locally with **SQLite**  
- Organize code with **OOP** for better readability and maintainability  
- Simple and modern **GUI with CustomTkinter**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) – modern GUI library  
- SQLite3 – local database  
- Pandas – data manipulation  
- Matplotlib – data visualization  
- OOP – clean code architecture
